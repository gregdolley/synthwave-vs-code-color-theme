# synthwave-vs-code-color-theme
Starting from Robb Owen's SynthWave '84 neon syntax highlighting VS Code extension and the associated VS Code color theme, this repo is my modification of the VS Code color theme only. This repo contains my version of that color theme that can be installed along side Robb's original extension.
