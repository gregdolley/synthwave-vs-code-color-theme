# SynthWave '84 Improved VS Code Color Theme

Starting from Robb Owen's SynthWave '84 neon syntax highlighting VS Code extension and the associated VS Code color theme, this repo is my modification of the VS Code color theme only. I didn’t like how the original theme hides some borders of UI elements and, for the borders which were visible, they were quite low contrast making it hard for me to see. This repo contains my version of that color theme, replacing the parts I didn’t like, and that can be installed along side Robb's original extension.
